## Street Vendors app

Indian consumers preferred to buy fruits and vegetables from local markets(53.3%) and push carts. Majority feels that branded products contain preservatives and are overpriced. Street vendors are a constant presence in our cities, but they often suffer harassment at the hands of authorities, under constant threat of being evicted from their place.

Since fruits and vegetables are perishable, if they are not sold at the right time, it will add a huge loss to their bussiness. Through this app, vendors can share their location and also list out the commodities they are going to sell along with cost. If the consumer is interested in buying, they can refer to the price and go to the location, buy the product.
